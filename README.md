A week with exactly one holiday is highlighted light green.

A week with more than one holiday is highlighted dark green.

If there are two adjacent holiday days in the same week, that entire row is highlighted yellow (adjacency visual priority).

Holiday days are labelled with a pill showing Holiday Name — Country and support hover/click for details.

Holidays are fetched from the backend or a holiday API per-country at runtime (no hard-coded holidays), and the app supports switching countries in the UI.

Two views: Monthly (full month grid) and Quarterly (3 months) — both obey the same color rules.
